# Expense Tracker React

## Design Approach
Admin style Dashboard design with sidebar having options allowing user to:
1. Analyze Finance using D3j Charts
2. Managed Incomes (Add & View)
3. Manage Budget (Add & View)
4. Manage Expenses (Add & View)
5. Logout

The design can be further extended to add more functionality under the individual tab options.

## Code Design
src/ => Core logic for application including router, app init, axios, etc
src/app/ => Component code for all the individual components such as dashboard, income, etc
src/assets/ => static assets such as logo etc
src/extra/ => static css files for additional style support
